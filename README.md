# **Zomato Data Analysis Project Using SQL**


## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Zomato data to extract meaningful insights that can aid restaurants
and stakeholders in understanding user behavior, popular items, and key performance metrics. 
I solved 15 specific analytical questions using SQL, demonstrating proficiency in data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.

## **Key Objectives**

1.**Identify Restaurant Performance:** Determine top-rated restaurants and high-revenue generators.
2.**Customer Behavior Analysis**: Analyze user ordering patterns and high-demand menu items.
3.**Operational Insights**: Measure average delivery times and successful delivery counts by delivery personnel.
4.**Payment Analysis:** Understand the distribution of online payment methods and their frequency.
5.**Complaint Analysis**: Identify common complaint types and restaurants associated with late deliveries.

## **SQL Techniques Utilized**
* **Aggregate Functions**: Used for calculations like total revenue, average rating, and order counts.
* **JOIN Operations**: Combined multiple tables to find insights such as user orders from high-rated restaurants.
* **Window Functions**: Ranked and filtered data, e.g., identifying top users and delivery personnel.
* **Conditional Statements (CASE)**: Segmented data to analyze payment types and complaint categories.
* **Subqueries:** Enhanced query efficiency and data segmentation for detailed analysis.
  
## **Analytical Questions Answered**
1. Top 5 restaurants with the highest average customer rating.
2. Top 5 users based on order frequency.
3. Total revenue generated by each restaurant.
4. Most ordered menu item across all restaurants.
5. Percentage of orders paid using online methods.
6. Average delivery time for each restaurant.
7. Top 3 delivery personnel with the most successful deliveries.
8. Top 3 common complaint types based on keyword analysis.
9. Users who have ordered from the same restaurant multiple times.
10. Percentage of orders with complaints.
11. Restaurants receiving complaints due to late deliveries.
12. Contribution of each order item to the total order amount.
13. Users who placed more orders than the average order frequency.
14. Users who ordered from restaurants with average ratings above 4.0.
15. Total number of orders placed on each day of the week.
    
## **Key Findings**
